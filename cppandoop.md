Four pillars of OOP:
- Abstraction: Only show necessary details to the user of the object
- Inheritance: Class reusability
- Polymorphism
- Ensapsulation

**Everytime a function that doesn't change the class instance is called, it must be defined as const.**

Accessors are useful to control how users can change and see the instance. Variables are private, and getvar and setvar are implemented so as to control what the user wants to set the value as, or how we choose to show the variable as.

Classes can be compared physically and structurally. To compare them structurally we need to implement a compare function that take a pointer to an instance as an argument.

Some values can be non-members, and common to all instances of a class.
